Lint4j ("Lint for Java") is a static Java source and bytecode code analyzer that
detects locking and threading issues, performance and scalability
problems,  and checks complex contracts such as Java serialization
by performing type, data flow, and lock graph analysis.

Lint4j was created to help software developers detect defects in
Java source code. It is a code reviewer for new code, and an early
warning tool for codebases that were developed by third-party
companies or come from the open-source world. Lint4j is targeted
towards developers, and helps finding many problems before even
running the software or writing the first test case.

A PDF document covering Lint4j features and configuration is available
in the "doc" directory.
