You're currently playing, so the computer assumes you have picked 
a number in your mind between 1 and 1000.  

The computer is trying to guess your number.  Each time, you must type
"higher" or "lower", and it will offer new guesses.  If the computer
has guessed the proper number, type "yes" at the prompt, then press
enter.

If you wish to end before the computer has guessed your number, type
"end" at the prompt, then press enter.

If you enter "higher" or "lower" incorrectly, just type "oops" and it
will give you the previous query.
